## Project Desctiption

The goal is to use computer vision to track people in a room or rooms and place them onto a 2D grid, marking their location. This technology would be useful for anyone trying to find someone else in room/building, plus it would be fun to have a real life version of the Marauder's Map from Harry Potter.

A common problem in large buildings is trying to figure out the location of certain people who you need to talk to or deliver things too. Using cameras situated throughout a building, a map with the location of everyone in the building could be constructed, making locating individuals easier.

Specifically, this technology would be used in a collaborative workspace where people want to be available to help others. Some jobs require people to spend time in a variety of places. For instance, a researcher might spend time in a lab, in a machine shop creating equipment, or in a computer room analyzing data. Providing a real-time map of workers and their locations would make it easier for colleagues to find one other. This would not compromise privacy as a worker is supposed to be available while at work and not hidden. It would merely save a colleague a few minutes of searching around to find the person they needed to talk to. The technology could also be used to keep track of which professionals are currently available in a given helproom or other place where assistance is expected to be given. If a person marks themselves to be tracked in such a room, it is expected that they are there to render assistance and thus would not want to be hidden.
